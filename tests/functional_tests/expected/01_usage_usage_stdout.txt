usage: tcmReceiver [-h] [-d DEVICE] [-i DATAFILE] {capture,print,publish} ...

TcmReceiver
===========

Python based application to analyze the data of a 433 MHz thermometer received
using an Arduino. The extracted data is sent via MQTT.

This command provides the following subcommands:
  - "capture" to capture raw data from the serial port and save it in a file.
    This helps development and debugging this application.
  - "print" to parse the data from the serial port or a previously recorded
    file and print the results on stdout.
  - "publish" to parse the data from the serial port or a previously recorded
    file and publish the mqtt messages.

See the help of the individual subcommands for more information and the
command line options.

positional arguments:
  {capture,print,publish}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        The serial port device to open. Default: /dev/ttyUSB0.
  -i DATAFILE, --input-file DATAFILE
                        Instead of using a serial port, read the data from the specified data file (previously captured using the -c option).
